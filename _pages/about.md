# Our Values
our_values:
  heading: "What Makes Us Unique"
  text: |+
    **Trust** is at the core of our work ethic. When you choose to work with us, we want you to feel like _you can trust us fully_, both in our _technical ability_ and as _humans_. We also want to _feel the same towards you_.

    **Our clear-cut methodology** is our stepping stone for building that trust. Once your idea is fleshed out and the project specifications are written (with or without Forever Bije included in this process), we will provide you with a _detailed development planning_. It will contain estimates for every part of the project, development milestones, testing phases, and production deployment. As the project advances, we will provide _frequent updates_, with an iterative approach, **to make sure our visions are aligned at all times**. Eventually, we will write a technical documentation/user guide and ensure that _your team understands/can make use of everything we've developed_ before we consider our collaboration complete.

  text2: |+
    During development, we strongly believe in the importance of **Unit Testing** to make sure everything that we code is in accordance with the specifications. It takes a bit longer to ship code, but it gives us (and more importantly, **you**) _the confidence that everything works now_, and that _future developments will be possible_ without the fear of unwanted breaking changes.

    We are preferably looking for **projects with an _impact_** (social, environmental, etc.) because we believe the more help we can bring to the community, the better."

  text3: |+
    **Forever Bije** was initially created to give a framework to the activities of St√©phane and Vincent. Depending on the size of your project, we can also leverage **a network of trustworthy and talented freelancers** with _years of experience working together_, whom we consider part of our team.

    Forever Bije is the holder of the French **Agr√©ment au Cr√©dit Imp√¥t Innovation** (an innovation-related tax credit certificate). If you are a French organization, you can include our invoices in your CII expenses, and _get additional tax returns from our collaboration_."
