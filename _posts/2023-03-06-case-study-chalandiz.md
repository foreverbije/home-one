TL;DR : We've been working with Chalandiz since we started Forever Bije in 2019. We take part in the 2 stages of the Chalandiz service : provide responsive websites to clients quicker (using a template we coded) and maintain the platform allowing clients to fully administrate it (Categories, Shops, News, Job Offers, Images etc.)
