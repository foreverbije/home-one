TL;DR : We've been working with Simplébo for 2 years on two aspects of IT. We first audited the codebase & organization of one of the two dev teams there, gave our feedback & advice as "outsiders". We then helped with the implementation of these advice, better unit testing, code cleaning, etc. by being involved in the daily run of product features.
